# ROIFE BLOG

This is my personal blog. The topics are mainly about CS.

The theme was based on [Hux Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) and I made lots of modifications.

## Q & A

#### What are the differences between the theme of `Hux Blog` and of this blog?

- Add support for KaTeX & Update MathJax
- Use utterances
- Remove sidebar in homepage (for conciseness)
- Modify tagclouds in `Archive` page to support secondary tag
- Add support for zooming images
- Add `back-to-top` button
- Add auto-scroll for catalogs
- Remove service worker (PWA)
- ...

#### How to build my own blog based on the theme?

If you love the theme, I really recommend you to fork from [Hux Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) and modify the theme by yourself if you are familiar with HTML/CSS/JS.

But if you don't want to spend much time on the theme and want to focus on writing. Just fork this repo, and put you posts in `_posts`. You should also modify `_config.yml` and `_includes/about/zh.md` which places your personal information and introduction.
