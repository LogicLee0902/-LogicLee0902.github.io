# ROIFE BLOG

This is my personal blog to place my notes and posts. The topics are mainly about CS.

The theme was based on [Hux Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) and I have done lots of modifications on it.

## Q & A

#### What are the differences between themes `Hux Blog` and `ROIFE BLOG`?

- Add support for KaTeX & Update MathJax
- Use utterances & Remove Disqus
- Remove sidebar in homepage (for conciseness)
- Modify tagclouds in `Archive` page to support secondary tag
- Add support for zooming images
- Add `back-to-top` button
- Add auto-scroll for catalogs
- Remove service worker
- ...

#### How to build my own blog based on the theme?

If you love the theme, I really recommend you to fork from [Hux Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) and modify the theme by yourself if you are familiar with HTML/CSS/JS, because it is the differences between blogs that make personal blogs more interesting.

However, I would also appreciate it if you don't what to spend much time on theme modification and want to focus on writing. Just fork this repo, and put you posts in `_posts`. You should also modify `_config.yml` and `_includes/about/zh.md` which places your information and introduction.

For more customization, you can explorer the codes by yourself which plenties of comments to help you understand.
